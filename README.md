## üéØ Overview

CrewShift is designed for workers in rotating shift environments (manufacturing, security, healthcare, 24/7 services). It provides a visual calendar that automatically calculates shift patterns based on a repeating cycle, while allowing individual customization for vacations and special days.

### Key Features

- üîÑ **Automatic Shift Pattern Calculation**: 9-day rotating cycle (3 days early shift, 3 days late shift, 3 days off)
- üë• **Multi-Crew Support**: Manage different teams with staggered start dates
- üé® **Intuitive Color-Coded Visualization**: Easy to distinguish between shift types and days off
- ‚úèÔ∏è **Customizable Schedule**: Manually override specific days for vacations or special events
- üìä **Analytics Dashboard**: Track days off, shift balance, and vacation usage
- üåç **Holiday Integration**: Built-in support for Irish public holidays (easily extendable)
- üîê **User Authentication**: Secure Google Sign-In with Firebase
- ‚òÅÔ∏è **Cloud Sync**: Data synchronized across devices via Firestore
- üì± **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices

## üèóÔ∏è Technology Stack

- **Frontend Framework**: Angular 20.3.3 (Standalone Components)
- **UI Library**: PrimeNG with custom Material Design theme
- **Backend**: Firebase (Authentication & Firestore)
- **Language**: TypeScript 5.9.2
- **State Management**: Angular Signals
- **Styling**: SCSS with responsive design
- **Build Tool**: Angular CLI with esbuild

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher recommended)
- npm or yarn
- Firebase project (see setup instructions below)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/crew-shift.git
   cd crew-shift
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Firebase**

   - Create a new Firebase project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
   - Enable Authentication with Google Sign-In provider
   - Create a Firestore database in production mode
   - Copy the Firebase configuration from your project settings

4. **Set up environment files**

   ```bash
   # Copy the example environment file
   cp src/environments/environment.example.ts src/environments/environment.ts
   cp src/environments/environment.example.ts src/environments/environment.prod.ts
   ```

   Then edit both files and replace the placeholder values with your Firebase configuration:

   ```typescript
   export const environment = {
     production: false, // true for environment.prod.ts
     firebase: {
       apiKey: 'YOUR_FIREBASE_API_KEY',
       authDomain: 'YOUR_PROJECT_ID.firebaseapp.com',
       projectId: 'YOUR_PROJECT_ID',
       storageBucket: 'YOUR_PROJECT_ID.firebasestorage.app',
       messagingSenderId: 'YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID',
       appId: 'YOUR_APP_ID',
       measurementId: 'YOUR_MEASUREMENT_ID',
     },
   };
   ```

5. **Configure Firestore Security Rules**

   In your Firebase console, set the following Firestore security rules:

   ```javascript
   rules_version = '2';
   service cloud.firestore {
     match /databases/{database}/documents {
       match /users/{userId} {
         allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
       }
       match /analytics/{document=**} {
         allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
       }
     }
   }
   ```

6. **Run the development server**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload when you change source files.

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## üìñ Usage

### First Time Setup

1. Open the application and sign in with your Google account
2. Select your crew from the available options
3. The calendar will automatically display your shift pattern

### Managing Your Schedule

- **View Shifts**: The calendar color codes your shifts:

  - üü° Yellow: Early shift
  - üü† Orange: Late shift
  - üü¢ Green: Days off
  - üü£ Purple: Annual leave
  - üî¥ Red dot: Public holidays

- **Modify Days**: Click on any day to change its type
- **Plan Vacations**: Mark days as annual leave (31-day limit per year)
- **Reset Changes**: Clear individual days or all modifications
- **View Statistics**: Check your time off balance and shift distribution

### Settings

Access settings via the gear icon to:

- Switch between different crews
- Toggle week start (Sunday/Monday)
- Sign out
- View analytics

## üîí Security Considerations

### Firebase API Keys

The Firebase API key in the environment files is **intentionally public** for frontend applications. However, you must:

1. **Configure domain restrictions** in Firebase Console under "Authentication > Settings > Authorized domains"
2. **Set up Firestore security rules** to protect user data (see setup instructions above)
3. **Enable App Check** for additional security (recommended for production)

### Data Privacy

- All user data is stored per-user in Firestore with strict security rules
- Only authenticated users can access their own data
- Local storage is used as a fallback for offline functionality
